## Reasoning Behind Decisions:
As the description, the Block chain is similar to Linked List so I use the idea of linked list to implement.
We only write code for append, and using array is good enough.

## Time Efficiency:
Thee time complexity to append a block to the linkedlist =>  O(1).
Worst case for searching it will O(n)

## Space Efficiency:
n is the number of blocks => O(n)
