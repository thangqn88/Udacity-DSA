### Task0
- Time complexity: O(1). Accessing the array via index have time complexity O(1)
- Space complexity: O(1)

### Task1
- Time complexity: O(m+n) where m is total items of the "texts" and n is total items of the "calls"
- Space complexity: O(n)

### Task2
- Time complexity: O(n) Because we loop over the calls
- Space complexity: O(n)

### Task 3
- Time complexity:
    - Part A:  O(n*log n) 
        - scan the list "calls" twices O(2n) => O(n)
        - use sort() in func: get_distinct_codes_called_by_bangalore => O(n*logn)
    - Part B: O(n) Because we scan the list "calls"

### Task 4
- Time complexity: 0(n*logn) Because we scan the list "texts"and "calls" and we have sorted() which have O(n*logn)
